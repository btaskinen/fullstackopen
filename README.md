# Full Stack open course

This repo contains code created while working through the [Full Stack open course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) offered by the University of Helsinki.

It contains code created while following along through each part of the course as well as code created while doing the exercises for each part.

The following React apps were created while working through the exercises:

1. Part 1

- [Course information](https://github.com/btaskinen/fullstackopen/tree/main/part1/courseinfo). This was mainly an exercise to refactor code into different components and learn basics of JavaScript.
- [Uni Cafe](https://github.com/btaskinen/fullstackopen/tree/main/part1/unicafe). App that collects user feedback from visitors of the Uni Cafe and calculates statistics.

2. Part 2

5. Part 5

   In Part 5, user login was added to the frontend of the [Blog List App](https://github.com/btaskinen/fullstackopen/tree/main/part4/blog-list) and the frontend was tested with react-testing-library (unit tests) and Cypress (end-to-end tests).

   In Part 6, different state management approaches were introduced: Redux, React Query, useReducer and context.

7. Part 7
